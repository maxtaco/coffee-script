  CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
  IcedCoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript that adds two new 
  keywords: await and defer.

  If you have the Node Package Manager installed:
  npm install -g iced-coffee-script
  (Leave off the -g if you don't wish to install globally.)

  Or, if you don't wish to use npm:
  sudo bin/cake install

  Execute a script:
  iced /path/to/script.coffee

  Compile a script:
  iced -c /path/to/script.coffee

  For documentation, usage, and examples, see:

  For iced-specific technical documentation, see:

  Note about handling errors with `source-map-support`:

  Since v108.0.15 (2019-12-20), IcedCoffeeScript uses `source-map-support`
  package to handle location mapping for stack traces for errors coming from
  IcedCoffeeScript code. It's enabled by default when using `iced` to run
  scripts or when using `register` to enable IcedCoffeeScript in Node's module
  system.

  To enable it manually (e.g. in environments other than Node.js or when not
  using `register`), use the following API:

  ```
  require('iced-coffee-script').installSourceMapSupport({})
  ```

  This function can also be called with options for `source-map-support`
  instead of an empty object. Available options are described in
  `source-map-support` README file.

  To use the old error handler, use the following API instead:

  ```
  require('iced-coffee-script').installPrepareStackTrace()
  ```
